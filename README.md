# CAI SE Indonesia Demo Workspace

This repository is the shared workspace for the CAI SE Indonesia demo environment on Cloudera AI.

It contains three application tracks:

- `ask-data` — general-purpose AI analytics assistant (Ask the Data / NL-to-SQL)
- `fraud-ai-assistant` — fraud-focused AI assistant with dashboard, investigations, and ML workflows
- `agent-studio` — experimental agent applications built with the Cloudera Agent SDK

## Current Shared Platform Configuration

These values are the current shared defaults for the CAI deployment:

- Impala database: `cai_sdx_se_indonesia`
- Shared data root: `s3a://go01-demo/user/cai-demo-se-indonesia/data/`
- Core tables:
  - `customers`
  - `deposits`
  - `credits`
  - `fraud_transactions`

Both `ask-data` and `fraud-ai-assistant` share the same Impala connection pattern via environment variables:

- `IMPALA_HOST`
- `IMPALA_PORT`
- `IMPALA_HTTP_PATH`
- `CDP_USER`
- `CDP_PASS`
- `DB_NAME`

## Main Components

### `ask-data`

General-purpose AI analytics assistant. Ask questions about structured data in natural language — no SQL knowledge required.

- FastAPI backend with NL-to-SQL via Azure OpenAI and Impala/CDW execution
- Next.js 15 frontend with Cloudera-branded design (dark navy sidebar, indigo accent, orange CTAs)
- Typography: Inter (body), Outfit (headings), JetBrains Mono (code/numeric) — all via Google Fonts
- Icons: `@mui/icons-material` throughout — no inline SVGs
- Read-only Impala query execution with SQL guardrails and PII blocking
- Generic enough to reuse across different banking or enterprise customers
- Deployed as two separate Cloudera AI Applications (backend + frontend)
- Optional RAG Studio integration for document-grounded answers, with per-session configuration stored in backend memory
- RAG answers surface source cards with an `Open Source PDF` action when source metadata is available
- Demo Guide redesigned for management-level audiences: Business Impact first, scannable bullets, ready-to-use demo prompts
- Usage Dashboard analytics glitch fixed — no more re-fetch loop on tab switch

See [`ask-data/docs/project-state.md`](ask-data/docs/project-state.md) for full implementation and deployment details.

### `fraud-ai-assistant`

Fraud-specific demo track combining an AI assistant with a full analytics console and ML workflows.

- FastAPI backend tuned for fraud analysis queries
- Next.js frontend with four core views: Dashboard, AI Assistant, Investigations, Model Management
- Fraud-aware schema and business context
- `ml-templates/` for baseline fraud model training and packaging
- Training workflow supports Impala as the primary CAI data source
- Deployed fraud model API validated in CAI

See [`fraud-ai-assistant/docs/project-state.md`](fraud-ai-assistant/docs/project-state.md) for full implementation and deployment details.

### `agent-studio`

Experimental track for agent applications built on the Cloudera Agent SDK.

- `marketing-content-intelligence/` — multi-agent pipeline for marketing content analysis

### Shared files

- `sample/` — generated CSVs for local development and fallback testing
- `generate_demo_data.py` — produces synthetic demo datasets
- `impala_demo_ddl.sql` — shared Impala DDL for all core tables
- `submit_impala_schema.py` — applies the DDL to Impala from a configured Python session
- `scripts/` — repository sync and helper scripts used during CAI operations

## Recommended Usage Model

### In Cloudera AI

- keep GitHub as the source of truth
- sync the CAI project from GitHub
- inject runtime configuration through CAI environment variables (never commit secrets)
- run backend and frontend as separate CAI Applications
- use CAI Jobs for repeatable training, schema, or deployment tasks

### Locally

- use the repo for editing, review, and documentation
- use `sample/` CSV data for local fallback when Impala is not available
- validate final runtime behavior in CAI — especially for networking and authentication
